# Lab 8 - Starter

Worker: Hao Yuan

1) ANS: It should be the first choice, that we debug the code every time we push it into github. This is exactly what's the meaning of automation and helps us to know the condition of the code in time.
2) ANS: No, since E2E tries to replicate a userâ€™s workflow from start to finish, which make it not ideal to test output of one function.
3) ANS: No, given the cons that 'Cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level.'
4) ANS: Yes, only to test the max message length feature is a small part of testing. Using unit test should be much easier and quicker.
